            Transhumanism is often pitched as tomorrow's frontier, yet the project
            of bending biology to intention began the moment agriculture taught us
            to re-script the earth. Rosi Braidotti calls us "already posthuman"
            because every tool extends the species beyond its native limits. If so,
            the question is no longer when augmentation starts, but how we narrate
            its present layers responsibly.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "We are already posthuman since the agricultural revolution began."
            — Rosi Braidotti
          </blockquote>
          <h2>Three strata of augmentation</h2>
          <p>
            Slavoj Žižek's provocations help me name three overlapping strata where
            augmentation operates: the social, the individual, and the
            sub-individual. Socially, we have always engineered the substrate that
            sustains us—domesticating plants, selecting animals, and scripting
            infrastructures that loop back to rewrite our bodies through diet,
            medicine, and labour. Individually, we reach for glasses, prosthetics,
            stimulants, and rituals that let the organism answer survival with
            cunning. At the sub-individual level, CRISPR kits, neurochemical
            interventions, and wetware speculation make explicit what was once an
            artisanal tinkering with hormones and neurotransmitters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grouping these strata clarifies that every upgrade has already been a
            negotiation between agency and constraint. The novelty is not in
            enhancement itself but in the precision with which we can now edit the
            code beneath experience.
          </p>
          <h2>Simulated experience and the real</h2>
          <p>
            Žižek lingers on the weirdness of experiences delivered straight into
            the nervous system: induced memories, designer emotions, prosthetic
            sensations. When the line between the actual and the simulated begins to
            diffuse, identity is forced to confront its own construction. What does
            authenticity mean if delight can be injected or grief can be
            paused? Neither nostalgia nor technophilia resolves the tension. We are
            left debating which experiences we will allow to script our habits of
            caring for one another.
          </p>
          <h2>Source–sink dilemmas</h2>
          <p>
            I picture transhumanism as a negotiation over source and sink
            mechanisms—the evolving loops that let societies metabolise desire
            without burning out. Historically, these loops emerged organically: the
            pursuit of myths, the regulation of neurotransmitters, the reciprocity
            of communal life. A market-driven augmentation paradigm risks replacing
            shared source–sink systems with privately curated inputs. The ethical
            dilemma is not that the new inputs exist, but that they can bypass the
            slow calibrations that kept desires and obligations in dialogue.
          </p>
          <h2>Drawing lines without freezing progress</h2>
          <p>
            Rapid developments in gene editing, biocomputing, and neurotech tempt
            us to seek definitive lines—permissions etched into policy like
            guardrails. Yet history suggests that strict bans rarely halt
            experimentation; they delay it while concentrating power in darker
            corners. The challenge is to distinguish iterative refinement from the
            kind of rupture that renders our ethical vocabulary obsolete. Francis
            Fukuyama's caution echoes here: humility toward nonhuman nature must be
            matched by humility toward our own.
          </p>
          <h2>Optimism with teeth</h2>
          <p>
            For all my skepticism, I remain optimistic. Humanistic, even Marxian,
            readings of transhumanism invite us to see augmentation as a commons to
            be stewarded, not an end-state reserved for the few. Equity is not a
            sentimental add-on; it determines whether progress amplifies or erodes
            our collective agency. I have little interest in purely physicalist end
            times—computronium as utopia—but I do believe we are only beginning to
            understand the phenomenology of augmented life. Progress that stays in
            conversation with that mystery feels worth defending.
          </p>
          <p>
            So disagreement is welcome. The posthuman condition is not a manifesto
            already written; it is an unfolding dialogue about which futures we are
            willing to inhabit together.
