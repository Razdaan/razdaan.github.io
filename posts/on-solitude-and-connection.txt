On Solitude and Connection
2025-12-28
We are social creatures who need to be alone.

There is a quality of presence that only emerges in solitude. When the noise of others fades, we begin to hear ourselves. Not the self that performs for the world, but the quieter voice beneath—the one that wonders, doubts, dreams.

Blaise Pascal wrote that all of humanity's problems stem from our inability to sit quietly in a room alone. We flee from ourselves into distraction, into company, into endless activity. Yet what we flee from is precisely what we need to face.

Solitude is not loneliness. Loneliness is the ache of disconnection, the sense of being unseen. Solitude is chosen separation—a deliberate stepping back to see more clearly.

The paradox is that genuine connection requires this capacity for solitude. Only when we can be alone with ourselves can we truly be present with another. Otherwise, we bring our neediness, our performance, our fear of the empty room.

Rilke advised young poets to "love your solitude and bear the pain of it with sounding lamentation." Not to avoid the difficulty, but to move through it. On the other side lies a self that doesn't need constant validation, that can offer presence rather than demand it.

In our hyperconnected age, solitude has become almost countercultural. We carry the world in our pockets, always available, always distracted. Perhaps the most radical act now is to put down the phone and sit with silence.

What arises when you do? Boredom, at first. Then restlessness. But if you stay—if you resist the urge to fill the space—something else emerges. Call it presence. Call it self. Call it the beginning of wisdom.
