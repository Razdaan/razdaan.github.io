            Sufism is often cast as Islam's wild, ecstatic counterpart—whirling
            dervishes, verses of longing, and the dissolving of self. The stereotype
            misses the discipline. What if Sufism is not a departure from
            orthodoxy, but its most rigorous interior form?
          </p>
          <h2>Essence over form</h2>
          <p>
            Orthodoxy seeks correctness: the right rituals, sanctioned readings, the
            inherited choreography of faith. The danger is fossilisation. Sufism
            interrogates the form so that the essence can breathe. It strips away
            superstition, performative piety, and intellectual vanity in pursuit of
            intimacy with the Divine.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that sense, Sufism is hyper-orthodox. It insists that every practice
            must re-route through sincerity. The aim is not rebellion but
            purification—an attempt to inhabit revelation fully, not merely cite it.
          </p>
          <h2>Tawhid as lived reality</h2>
          <p>
            The doctrine of <em>tawhid</em> (oneness) is taught in classrooms as
            theology, but Sufis demand it as experience. Through <em>zikr</em>, music,
            silent vigils, and the guidance of teachers, seekers attempt to
            internalise unity until the distinction between watcher and watched
            thins. The path is ascetic, poetic, and relentless.
          </p>
          <h2>Beyond intermediaries</h2>
          <p>
            Abrahamic traditions often rely on prophets and clergy as mediators of
            grace. Sufism honours them, yet it refuses to stop there. The emphasis is
            on cultivating a direct, unmediated relationship with the Divine—one
            that holds orthodoxy to its own promise. Liberation is not licence; it is
            accountability to the heart of the faith.
          </p>
          <h2>A discipline of unveiling</h2>
          <p>
            At its most demanding, Sufism is a methodology of unveiling. It asks the
            seeker to submit ego, examine attachments, and become a living testament
            to the scripture's transformative power. Mysticism here is not soft
            romance; it is a steady chiselling away of whatever separates the
            believer from the Beloved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seen from this angle, Sufism may indeed be the highest form of orthodoxy
            because it refuses to let orthodoxy ossify. It insists that faith remain
            a verb.
