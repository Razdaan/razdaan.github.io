            Doubt is rarely an empty field. It is topographical, thickened by the
            sediment of prior certainties. The more we learn to live with
            uncertainty, the more we notice the irregular ridges where confidence
            once stood. This essay traces those ridges, following Derrida's
            concept of différance as both invitation and interruption.
          </p>
          <h2>Mapping the Unfixed</h2>
          <p>
            The classical map assumes a stable earth. Cartography collapses if
            the continent shifts while the ink dries. Postmodern thought begins
            from this erosion: the realization that meaning keeps moving even as
            we try to measure it. Derrida's différance is not a simple delay; it
            is a refusal to let the sign settle. Meaning is an ever-deferring
            horizon, reached only in fragments.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "To differ is to defer, to let the trace breathe before it becomes an
            idol." — field note, 2023
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In practice, this means embracing annotation as a core philosophical
            method. Rather than presenting arguments as monoliths, we stage them
            as conversations between footnotes, images, and incidental sounds. A
            map of doubt must be multi-sensory, carrying the rustle of the archive
            and the hum of the street.
          </p>
          <h2>Careful Skepticism</h2>
          <p>
            Skepticism is often framed as combative. Here, we re-situate it as a
            practice of care. To remain skeptical is to remain open, to refuse the
            ease of premature resolution. Careful skepticism is slow: it listens to
            context, honors anomalies, resists instrumentalizing every encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take the urban bench. It seems like a minor artifact until one notices
            the spikes placed to deter rest. The bench becomes a text. The spikes
            become a footnote. Reading the city through skepticism reveals how
            power scripts comfort and discomfort into public space.
          </p>
          <h2>Living with Lacunae</h2>
          <p>
            Living inside postmodern doubt is not an abdication of meaning; it is
            an invitation to co-author it. The lacuna is a room where collective
            sense-making can occur. In teaching, I ask students to hold the gap for
            at least a week before offering interpretations. Inevitably, new
            questions emerge—questions that were invisible when we rushed to close
            the file.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cartography of doubt is never complete. Every essay renders only a
            single layer, a partial projection. The practice is to keep mapping,
            knowing that each map is provisional, each path an experiment in
            living with the unfinished.
