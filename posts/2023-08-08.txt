On Sufism
2023-08-08
The word Sufism reminds me of whirling Turkish dervishes, Rumi's poetry, and a profound, often ecstatic, connection with the Divine. It's frequently seen as the antithesis of orthodoxy, a rejection of rigid dogma in favor of a more personal, experiential path to God. But what if, Sufism, in its purest form, isn't a departure from orthodoxy, but rather its most elevated expression?

Orthodoxy, at its core, seeks to establish the "correct" way of practicing a faith. This can often lead to an emphasis on rules, rituals, and interpretations handed down through tradition. The danger here, as Sufis astutely point out, is that these external forms can become ends in themselves, obscuring the original intent of the faith: a genuine connection with the Divine.

Sufism, in my understanding, shares this fundamental goal with orthodoxy: to facilitate a relationship with God. However, it approaches this goal from a radically different angle. Instead of focusing on the form of worship, Sufism emphasizes the essence. It advocates for stripping away all that is extraneous – the superstitions, the blind adherence to ritual, the intellectual abstractions – to reveal the pure, unadulterated core of spiritual experience.

This relentless focus on purification, on removing the veils that separate the seeker from the Beloved, is, in a paradoxical sense, the ultimate act of orthodoxy. Sufism seeks to purify not only the practice of faith but also the heart of the believer. It demands a rigorous self-examination, a constant striving to eliminate the ego and its attachments, which are seen as the primary obstacles to divine union.

The Sufi path, as I see it, is not a rejection of tradition, but a radical internalization of it. It's about taking the principles of the faith and embodying them fully, transforming them from external observances into lived realities. The Sufi aims to become a living embodiment of the divine teachings, a walking testament to the transformative power of faith.

Consider the concept of tawhid, the oneness of God, a central tenet of Islam. In a purely orthodox sense, it might be understood as a theological doctrine, a statement of belief. But in Sufism, tawhid becomes an experience, a lived reality in which the seeker transcends the illusion of separation and realizes their fundamental unity with the Divine.

This emphasis on direct experience, on maarifat, is what sets Sufism apart. It's not enough to intellectually affirm the existence of God; the Sufi seeks to know God through direct, personal communion. This is achieved through various practices, including zikr (remembrance of God), meditation, music, poetry, and the guidance of a spiritual teacher.

Ultimately, the Sufi path, as I understand it, is a journey of purification and unveiling. It is a process of removing the layers of illusion and superstition that obscure the Divine Light within. And in doing so, the Sufi may, paradoxically, arrive at the most profound and authentic expression of orthodoxy: a faith lived with every breath, a connection with God that is direct, immediate, and unwavering. 

Furthermore, Sufism, in its emphasis on the direct connection with the divine, offers a contrast to the Abrahamic emphasis on prophethood. While the belief in prophets is central to Abrahamic faiths, it can also create a sense of limitation for the individual, who may feel reliant on intermediaries and external authority. Sufism, by transcending these abstractions, empowers the individual to seek a more immediate and personal relationship with God, free from the constraints of dogma and intermediaries.
