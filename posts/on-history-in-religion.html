            Strategy has always relied on narrative. Long before modern analytics,
            communities reached for ancestral stories to frame future action.
            Realists argue that some instincts remain immune to progress; this essay
            follows that instinct through early Christianity, Islam, and the modern
            sciences.
          </p>
          <h2>Vacancies in early theology</h2>
          <p>
            The centuries after Jesus were anything but serene. A fledgling movement
            wrestled with internal power struggles, imperial politics, and doctrinal
            uncertainty. The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) did more than settle
            metaphysics; it filled a vacuum. Greek philosophical categories supplied
            language for mystery, lending the Trinity a conceptual scaffolding drawn
            from an "alien" philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Islam's early centuries mirrored parts of this arc. Translation projects
            in Abbasid Baghdad flooded scholarly circles with Hellenistic thought.
            Theologians such as al-Ghazali laboured to reconcile revelation with
            imported categories. Violence—assassinations of caliphs, schisms that
            hardened into sects—revealed how narrative authority often rests on those
            willing to defend their version of the past.
          </p>
          <h2>Reformation and the politics of salvation</h2>
          <p>
            By 1500, the Catholic Church had amassed bureaucratic power layered with
            economic exploitation. Luther's challenge to indulgences exposed how
            salvation narratives could be monetised. His theses sparked a wave of
            dissent that linked theology, governance, and class anger. Stories about
            grace reconfigured European politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientific inquiry, from Copernicus to Galileo, threatened the same
            authority. The Church's resistance to heliocentrism cast religion and
            science as adversaries—a perception that lingers in colonial and
            postcolonial imaginations. Yet the Golden Age of Islam demonstrates that
            religious conviction and scientific innovation can thrive together when
            narratives of curiosity are affirmed rather than suppressed.
          </p>
          <h2>The stalled progress of psychological sciences</h2>
          <p>
            Physical and biological sciences advanced through shared assumptions of
            natural law. The social sciences, however, remain entangled in debates
            over human nature. Modern secular frameworks often assume a godless
            universe, which can bias interpretations of meaning-making, ideology, and
            sacrifice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinkers from Freud to Marx rooted ideology in instinct—sex, belonging,
            economics. William McDougall lamented that neglecting the depth of human
            nature undermined our ability to stabilize societies. The lingering
            puzzle is why people die for abstractions. Material explanations falter
            when confronted with martyrdom or revolution.
          </p>
          <h2>Oneness and life satisfaction</h2>
          <p>
            Recent research hints at what mystics have long suggested: belief in
            oneness correlates with well-being. A University of Mannheim study
            surveying over sixty thousand respondents linked a sense of unity with
            higher life satisfaction. Perhaps the crisis in social science stems from
            rejecting metaphysical commitments too quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Religious texts understand this intuitively. Roughly a third of the
            Bible, Qur'an, and Talmud is narrative—stories of past peoples meant to
            orient the present. Strategy is impossible without such storytelling. The
            task now is to wield narrative with intellectual honesty, acknowledging
            its power without surrendering to manipulation.
