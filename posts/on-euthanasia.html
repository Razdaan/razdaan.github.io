            Debates about euthanasia often circle around pain relief, yet the more
            intractable question is freedom. What becomes of personhood when mental
            and physical agency evaporate? If a life is reduced to involuntary
            biological endurance, do we honour humanity by insisting it continue?
          </p>
          <h2>When the body becomes a cage</h2>
          <p>
            I think of patients with locked-in syndrome whose minds remain lucid
            while their bodies stage a quiet mutiny. Communication collapses into a
            blink. Agency contracts to the diameter of the pupil. The person is
            present, yet unable to act on the world they still interpret clearly.
            Their freedom is not merely impaired; it is suspended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psychological captivity can be just as binding. Someone raised inside a
            meticulously manipulative household may inherit a fractured selfhood:
            distorted mirrors, performative affection, and the perpetual threat of
            withdrawal. Outwardly functional, inwardly trapped, they carry an
            imposed narrative that denies the authenticity of their own will.
          </p>
          <h2>Freedom as the precondition of dignity</h2>
          <p>
            Freedom is not an optional luxury layered atop life; it is what makes a
            life recognisably human. It allows us to pursue purposes, take
            responsibility, ask for help, and withdraw consent. Without freedom,
            existence risks becoming a bureaucratic project—processes managed in our
            name while the subjective core watches as a spectator.
          </p>
          <p>
            When freedom cannot be regained, the moral calculus shifts. Continuing
            life-support may protect an idea of sanctity, but it can also prolong a
            form of cruelty. Refusing euthanasia in such circumstances denies the
            individual's final act of authorship: the right to determine when life
            has ceased to be livable.
          </p>
          <h2>Between reclaimable and irretrievable</h2>
          <p>
            Not all suffering is terminal. There are illnesses that heal, traumas
            that yield to therapy, disabilities that coexist with joy. Freedom can
            return, or reconfigure itself through accommodation and solidarity.
            These situations call for patience, resourcing, and imaginative care—not
            endings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The distinction lies in whether autonomy can be restored. When bodies or
            minds collapse beyond reclamation, insisting on continuation risks
            turning life into a duty performed for others. The threshold is subtle,
            contextual, and must be discerned with the person whose life is at stake,
            not legislated from sterile abstraction.
          </p>
          <h2>Revisiting the sanctity of life</h2>
          <p>
            Invoking the sanctity of life should not require the preservation of
            mere biological function. Sanctity is a composite of meaning, dignity,
            and agency. A life bereft of these pillars becomes a hollow shrine to
            survival. To protect sanctity, we must centre quality, not simply
            quantity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upholding euthanasia as a compassionate option does not belittle the
            value of perseverance. It reframes perseverance as a choice rather than
            an obligation. The invitation is to treat freedom—especially mental
            freedom—as the context within which life gains its ethical weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we accompany someone to the edge of existence, our task is to guard
            their ability to decide. Sometimes that guardianship means helping them
            continue. Sometimes it means listening when they ask to stop.
